# RecordShot

This app helps users to take screenshots and record their screen. App captures the frame buffer which needs root user/superuser permissions (Linux-based Android OS), hence the app is a rooted one. There is also a non-rooted version which loads the background service off the PC to the mobile via an automated BASH/BATCH/PS script
